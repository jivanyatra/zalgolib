# ZalgoLibPy - A Full Zalgo Experience

### "Full"

While Zalgo text's popularity has waned, I'm still a fan. I also have a need for it. Other Zalgo libraries aren't recent, are a part of a larger set of tools, haven't been audited for security recently, or don't offer a lot of customization options.

The goal of this library is to give a decent set of defaults for Zalgo-ifying [encoding to Zalgo] and de-Zalgo-ifying [decoding from Zalgo] text to various degrees, as well as creating a custom class to dial in specific options.

I want to focus on functionality and periodically check in and update as needed. 
### License

I went with a permissive license (MIT) so feel free to use this any way you want. If you're proud of what you've made with my library, feel free to reach out and I'll try to add your project to a list below. Also, please check the credits section below, which also contributed to my choice to go with the MIT license.

### Credit

I am utilizing the list of diacritics that was carefully and conveniently laid out by [Gregory Neal](https://github.com/gregoryneal/) in his [Zalgo implementation](https://github.com/gregoryneal/zalgo/blob/master/code/zalgo_text/zalgo.py). Huge thanks to him for not only being a great programmer, but also using a very permissive MIT license that allows me to use a part of his work for my own. Just because I don't have to credit him doesn't mean I won't.
