# ZalgoLibPy - A Full Zalgo Experience

### "Full"

While Zalgo text's popularity has waned, I'm still a fan. I also have a need for it. Other Zalgo libraries aren't recent, are a part of a larger set of tools, haven't been audited for security recently, or don't offer a lot of customization options.

The goal of this library is to give a decent set of defaults for Zalgo-ifying [encoding to Zalgo] and de-Zalgo-ifying [decoding from Zalgo] text to various degrees, as well as creating a custom class to dial in specific options.

I want to focus on functionality and periodically check in and update as needed.
